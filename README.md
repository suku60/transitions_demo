# transitions_demo

this is a quick project i've created to explore different animations when changing from one react component to another. 

you'll find it deployed here: https://master.d196dnkzqovrte.amplifyapp.com/

you'll find 2 columns at the right side, choose an animation first and then an animal.

# how to use it

open a console and clone it:
``git clone https://github.com/suku60/transitions_demo``


install needed dependencies
``npm i``

run the frontend
``npm start``

if you want to edit the animations, you'll find them for now at index.css placed inside the src folder. 
play with css and explore all posibilities!
